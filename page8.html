		<h1>Why is photography necessary for cultural preservation?</h1>
		
		<h2>Task 1: Independant learning-Analyse the use of video on the web</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>What are the videos used for: I have used the patagonia promotional video, to display their clothing. https://eu.patagonia.com/gb/en/home/</li>
            <li>Can you find evidence of video used with intent:This video is a promotional video showing the viewer the capablities of their clothing. It is displaying the clothing in its raw form in harsh enviroments to demonstrate how appriorpate it is. The video is used with intent, and its delivery enhances the information on display and creates appeal.</li>
            <li>What benefits and caveats of video use can you witness:The benfits of this video is it allows the viewer to see the capabilities of the clothes in action, not just on a model. It is showing real people in real situations. The video is attention grabing and allows the viewer to emerse themselves in the video and go on the journey with them.</li>
            <li>Is the length of videos suitable:The video is relativly short, but this allows viewers to follow along the whole time and not get board. It is long enough to sell a product, ideal and journey but still punchy with its cinematic visuals and editing. </li>
            <li>How is video combined with other media: Thee video uses good audio, with sublime music, and spoken humour, this allows the company to sell the product effectivly. It also uses text to hammer home the main messages. The fast pace shots and music allow for it to presented in a good way.</li>
    </ul>

		<h2>Task 2: Generate a portfolio</h2>
      <P>For this I picked two landscape videos from https://www.pexels.com/videos/</P>
		
      <section id="task3">
		<h2>Task 3: Lab activities- Optimise your video for web use</h2>
<P> Here I combineded two videos from pexels, and created text and put moody background music on it. The idea here was to demonstrate the power of photography in preserving our cultural heritage. Video's like this would be a good contribution to the website as it is necessary to have multiple forms of media to enage the audiance. </P>
<p>I used imovie, as i work on a mac, and editied the two videos </p>
