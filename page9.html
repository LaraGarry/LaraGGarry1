		<h2>Task 1: Idependant learning:evaluate website against accessibility standards</h2>
   <P>I decided to use WAVE accessibility evaluation tool to check the standards of the national geographic website.https://www.nationalgeographic.com </P>
    
   <li>Surprisingly the website is not as accessibly as I once thought. WAVE displayed 39 errors, 21 contrast errors, 89 elerts, 383 ARIA, and 98 strucutual elements </li>
   <li>39 of the errors where due to empty headings, and 21 contrast errors where due to very low contrast.</li>
   <li>There was 89 alerts, containing things like: neaby image has the same alternative text, missing first level header, skipped heading level, redudnant link, redundant title.</li>
   <li>Overall I was dissapointed with the websties accesibility standards.</li>

   <div class="image-container">
    <img src="images /natgeowave.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 
    <img src="images /natgeowave2.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250">

		<h2>Task 2: Record your evaluation and reflect on your own practice</h2>
		<p>As evaluated above, the website needs a lot of imporvments to be fully accsible to all who want to access this. When considering my own website i need to make sure it is a top priorty to have accessibility for all as it is paramount.</p>
       <p>I had thought a great deal about the accessibility of my website, as i am tailoring to all ages. I have opted for a clean and sleek weebsite desing to appease all audiance and not drawn any confusing. I had thought about having clear headers and concise written information so that it was obvious for all to enage with. But upon enaging with WAVE I see there is much more that will need to be tailored to be inclusive and accsessible to all. This is not a point in which i can ignore or slip up in as my demographic of people is so vairied and the age range so differing, i need to make sure that I cater to all.</p>

            <h2>Task 5:What about other forms of accessibility?</h2>
        <P>to enhance the accessibility of my website, i will impliment a three fold strategy. Firstly, i will incorporate descript alt-tags for all images, providing essential information for users with visual impariments who rely on screen readers, this is particulalry important for me as my website is very photography and image based. Following Web conten accessibility guidelines WCAG, each image will have concise and meaningful alt-text to enhance the experiance. Secondly, to cater to users wth hearining impairments, detailed transcripts will accompany any audio or video clips on the website. These transcripts will offer accurate representations of spoken contnent, ensuring inclusivity. Lastly, to improve readability for all users, especially those with visual challeneges, i am optimising font choices and color contrast. This involves selecting clear fonts and ensuring adequate color differntiation between text and background, following WCAG standards. By systeatically addressing these aspects, the website aims to create a more universally acessible platfom, allopwing a diverse audiance to engage seamlessly with the presevation of cultural heritage through photography.  </P>
