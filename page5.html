		<h2>Task 2: evaluate resources using National geographic website</h2>

        <P>The National georgraphic photography websites exhibits a commendable adherence to several key principles of effective website writing, this being one of the reason I used it as an example website. Accuracy is paramount in their content, avoiding inaccuracies that could compromise the credibility of both the writers and the organisation in the competeitve market. The use of the active voice enhances clarity and engages the audience efferctively, steering clear or passice constructions that can obscure accountablity. </P>
        <P>The website makes a conscious effort to limit biases, opting for language like "they" to avoide gender bias and avoide sterotypes that might perpetuate biases related to age or race. They are particualrly good at cultural inclusion to allow for a wide range of audience. Clarity is maintained through the use of recognisable words, while they steer away from more technical termonology when they can, or explain comprehensivly.</P>
		<P> In terms of style, the prose is coversational, concise while flowing smoohtly. The avoidence of unecessary wordiness aligns with the impaitence of web readers, but they make sure to offer in depth article for those who prefer. Correctness in grammar and languae usage is diligently maintained, preventing the website from appearing sloppy.</P>
	    <P> The website achives sentence variety, and prioritises simple words overy showy vocabulary enhancing accessibility. The tone and voice of the writing is aptly adjusted to the nature of the content, showcasing an awareness of the inteded audience and purpose. National Geographic's photography website stands as a model for effective web writing, helping inspire how my own website will look.</P>

        <h3> Task 3: The AWE writing process</h3>
        <P>In developing my website about why photography is necessary to cultural heritage preservation, I have consistently applied principled focusing on acuracy, clarity and user engagment. Early on i defined my audience and the purpose of my website, this allowed me to characterise my audience to tailor the langue and style of my website. Once the purpose was cemented, I could create an informing, presuading, entertaing narritave to deliver this information to my audience. I was able to conduct sound reseasrch in what I think should be included in the wbesite to make sure my whole audience is enageed and gaining something from their vist. </P>
       <P>Once I carefully considered biases, ensuring I could use inclusive language ans steer away from sterotypes I could beging writing a draft. This point is slow as i have to read and revise to make sure i am including all the information but it is important to get right.</P>	
       <P> As the website still has far to go i havent gotten to editing much of my work yet, but i have been updated my metadata journal with all my research and using my mood boards for inspiration.</P>

<h3> Task 4: Using voyant-tools</h3>
<P>Voyant Tools is a web-based text analysis and visualisation tool that allows people to analyse and explore patterens withing a body of text. It provides various tools and visualisations to help users understand the structure, frequency, and relationships of words in sets of texts. It allowed me to examin the word frequency of the articles i was looking at, and it clearly identified the most frequently used words in a text. This allowed me to understand the key themes quickly and effectively, cutting out precious time. It also allowed me to use word clouds when looking at the text, to gain a visual representation of frequency of words used in the text, this was displayed with frequently used words appearing larger. Additionally, I was able to identify words that teneded to occur together, shedding light on contextual relationships through the collocation analysis. I also identified patterns in the artciles through the text dispersion plot, this showed me how frequently termes appeared through the text, clearly displaying patterns. Lasty I used term frequency and inverse document frequency, these metrics allowed me to identify contextual relationships. </P>

<h3> Task 5:Create sample text </h3>

<P> This is an example paragprahy for an opening punchy statment to loosely tell the user what to expect. The tonality is deliberatly informal to hummour all ages, but it remians clear and concise when needed, using active voice to enhance the clarity. It is short and punchy to grab the readers attention and to not bore them with a long spiel of jargon. There is deliberate use of a positive voice to empahsise the impact they could make. The sentence variety and simple words tailors to all ages, and creates interest. Overall it is a sound paragraph with some room for imporvment in areas. I will keep developing my lauguage to make sure i am delvering my writing well.   </P>

<h3> Task 6:summary</h3>
<P> This weeks independant learning and labs taks have allowed me to gain much knowlegd on my writing styles for the webstie. With readig all the examples and using voyant to understand professional writing charactersitcs, I was able to analyse effectivley to use in my own work. It made me look at my writing from a different perspective, with a more critical eye, and allowed me to narrow out bias and make sure enclusivity and accessibility where top priorty. After trialing out some of my own texts it was good to have this perspective to critically analyse my work so i can edit it effectively. Overall the learning this week has giving me a better perspective on how i should be tailoring my writing and research for my website.</P>
