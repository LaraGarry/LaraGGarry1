		<h1>Why is photography neccessary for cultural preservation?</h1>
		<h2>MAD(A) Project Homepage</h2>

		<p>Photography is an invaluable tool for preserving cultural heritage, capturing moments in time that might otherwise fade into obscurity. Through the lens of cameras, we can document our individual perspective of the world, ensuring that the stories, landmarks, and traditions of our past continue to resonate with future generations. From ancient ruins to indigenous ceremonies, photography has the power to bridge the gap between the past and the present, connecting us to our roots and fostering a deeper appreciation for the diverse cultures that make our world so beautiful. Through this website we shall explore the profound impact of photography in safeguarding our cultural legacies. All tasks below are from independent learning activitys or lab activities, each week contains all the task for both. </p>
