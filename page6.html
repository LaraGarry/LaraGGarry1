		<h2>Task 1: independant Learning the stages of creative process </h2>
<P> I am naturally a very creative person, it is one of the reasons I chose to incorporate photography into this project, as I already have a love for it. So the creative part of this project has been a joy for me. Early on I wanted to be able to incorporate my own images into the website, this helped hammer home my point of "anyone can do it". Before the I settled on my topic I debated a few other options, but ultimately went with this. From my idea I went and did research to make sure my point was in fact as important as I origionally thought, and it luckily was. I brainstormed for a while about my target audiance, and did initally want to target it at the younger generations, but it felt silly not to including so much of the population. From this it allowed me to consider how I might format and design such a website, having such a large target audience it was imperative that I tailored to all. I had to asses and criticise my work and origional flashier design for a more reserved accessible one, and from taking much inspiration from websites such as national geographic and patagonia, and consulting my moodboards, I loved the idea that the main focal point was the photography, and that I was reliant on this to display this message. It provides for an eye catching desing and again hammers home my origional point, it equally allows me to focus my attention on the main message and allow for a more accsessible website that is easy to navigate for all generations.  </P>

		<h2>Task 2: Analyse the use if Images on the web </h2>
<p>I once again went back and evaluated the image usage of National geographic website, and patagonia photograhy website</p>
<P> The website link is https://eu.patagonia.com/gb/en/home/</P>
        <ul>
				<li>What are the images used for?: The images on the patagonia website are there for astheics. The website has fostered the approach of a clean sleek look, using their photos for asthetic. The photos align with the companies goals and display how well their gear is getting used.  </li>
				<li> What is the intent of the images: The photos are also what you click on to take you to the next pages so they also have a purpose, with the correct labeling it is clearly this is a very flawless design.</li>
				<li>What kind of images are used: The images are predominantly raster with the occasional vector imgane to display an article. </li>
	
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/patagoniawebsite.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 
                    <img src="images/patagoniawebsite2.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 
                    <img src="images/patagoniawebsite3.png" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 
                    

                <p> This website is the goal for me. It incorpates quality, eyecatching photography as the main design feature and focus. The Raster images are predominantly used and it allows the user to have a visually appealing experiance, when raster images are inappropriate the use of vector images allow for a nice restbite and still aim to engage the audience. The images are all used with intent allowing them to have multiple uses, all image lead to other webpages for clothes, articles or campaings. This multipurpose is a smart way of formating the website. For my own website I think i need to find a good balance in raster vs vector photos, as i hadnt previosuly thought i would want any vector images before where i might now consider some. </p>

     <h2>Task 3: Generate a portfolio of images </h2>
<P> After doing much research on copyright and royalty free images, I decided i wanted my website to be made up of the photographs people are sending in as much as possible. I have used my own photographs for the majority of the website so far, and i think it will speak volumes to the people who are interacting on the website to know that all the photos on display are from people like them. </P>
<P> Below are some examples of the images i would like to use, as well as a vector image which i think would make a good trademark point on the website.</P>
                <img src="images/photography.png" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 
                <img src="images/horse.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 
                <img src="images/sunsetWtree.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 
                <img src="images/unigardens.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 
                <img src="images/cherryblossom.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 
                <img src="images/cow.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250">

    <h2>Task 4: Lab Task GIMP </h2>
    <P>First trial image below: Image depth. The quality isnt as good but it means it will load in better</P>
    <img src="images /cow-gimp-edit.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 

    <p>Second trial image with 1000px and 93ppi, is clearly not as high resolution</p>

<h2>Task 5: Summary </h2>
<P>The process of optimizing photography through a software such as GIMP holds implications for the overall impact and accessibility of images on my website. Optimization is nto just about reducing file sizes; its a strategic choice that influences the user experiance. The selection of parameters such as pixels per inch PPI, file size, and pixle dimensions can significantly affect image clarity, loading times and overall website perfirmance. Striking a blance on a website centered around photography is crucial- sufficent resolution to retain visual fidelity while ensuring a streamlined, fast loading website. Considering the diverse audience i have disscussed earlier, optimal choices for PPI, file sizes and pixle dimensions becomes paramount. For an inclusive experiance, a moderate PPI ensure clarity without unecessary data bloat, while adjusting picel dimensions and file sizes strikes a balance between visual appeal and swift loading times. In essence, thoughtful optimization becomes a cornerstone, enhancing the efficency of the website and ensuring that the beauty of preserved cultural heritage is accessible to all.</P>
