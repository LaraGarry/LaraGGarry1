		<h2>Task 1:Independant learning-analyse the use of audio on the web </h2>
		</section>
		
         <P> Once again I have decided to analyse the patagonia website, as it is so similar to the potential of my own. </P>		

         <ul>
				<li>What is the audio used for:A  promotional video demonstrating the clothing, the video is an ad but the cinematography and aduio makes it feel like an experiance, a movie. </li>
				<li>Can you find evidence of audio used with intent: The audio is there to enhance and provide a whole other layer to the website. It allwos you to enage another sense captivating the viewer. It enhances the ad and demonstrates the clothes effectively promising what is to come if you buy the clothes.</li>
				<li>What advantages and caveats of audio use can you witness?: The aduio enchances the user experiance, it allows the user to be fully emersed and captivated in the video, the funky music and humours dialog make you want to watch.</li>
                <li>How is audio combined with other media: The audio is accompanying videos on the website, that are promotional to the clothes. It is showing people on adventures using the outdoor gear, so there is speech along with background music.</li>
